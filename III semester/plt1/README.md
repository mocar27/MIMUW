# Programming languages and tools 1

This course was based on introducing and improving students' knowledge of various C++ possibilities and functions.

During these classes we've been working almost entirly using C++20.

Every project was made in pair, except for the last task. This was obligatory element of the course to improve soft skills and cooperation.

Full description of every task is available inside each directory (content of the tasks is available only in Polish).
