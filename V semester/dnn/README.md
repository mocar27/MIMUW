# Deep Neural Networks 

For the Deep Neural Networks course I was required to write a lot of line in Python Jupyter Notebook and train different models.

Each task was designed to cover different part of machine learning: 

- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)

I have added additional solutions to tasks that were designed for the final exam of the course.
The exam tasks covered additional Vision and NLP tasks.
