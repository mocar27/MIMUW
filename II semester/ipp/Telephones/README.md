# "Telephones" task

The program performs various operations on phone numbers using Trie structure, such as: 

* Adding redirections, from one phone to another.
* Getting reverse redirections - getting all phones that are redirected to given number.
* Removing and quickly, linearly, deleting whole Trie structure, depending on the number of nodes in the Trie.

Project is organized, readable and easily modifiable. Whole documentation was made using the Doxygen software.

Project operates on self written ***list*** library and self written ***string*** library. 

Files: `phone_forward.h` and `phone_forward_example.c` were provided by the author of the task, but they were modified by me.
