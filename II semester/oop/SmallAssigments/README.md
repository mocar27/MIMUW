# Smaller laboritory assigments

These are a few smaller tasks I was told to do during my Object Oriented Programming course.

## Chess

It is the program that plays chess computer vs. computer.

In order to start the game You have to choose in `Main.java` whether the player is:

* Random - moves of this player are random

* Predatory - when he can, he takes enemy's piece.

The game ends after 50 moves or when neither of the player is able to make any other move. 

## Mathematics

It is the program that solves small, simple mathematical tasks that are defined in the `Main.java` class.

It uses brackets, it can shorten equation and do some simplification.

It contains mathematical functions such as sum, multiplication, sine, cosine.

## Hanoi

It is the algorithm solving the Hanoi problem for given data.

## Sito

It is the algorithm of sieve of eratosthenes.
