# ***Languages and tools for programming II***

As a project for Languages and tools for programming II course we were required to build a microservices application.

It was written from scratch. It was developed in Python using Django for one microservice and Flask for the other one.

Frontend microservice was written in TypeScript and asynchronus requests were processed using RabbitMQ.

Project was contenerized using Docker.

Project was later deployed in Google Cloud, but currently it is not on.

Project was made in collaboration with [@Sandro770](https://github.com/Sandro770) and can be found [here](https://github.com/Sandro770/JNP).
