# "Labyrinth" task

The program looks for the shortest path in the ***k-dimensional*** maze that is described as:

* The first line contains ***k*** numbers, where ***k*** is number of dimensions in maze.
* The second line contains coordinates of the starting position.
* The third line contains coordinates of the end position.
* The fourth line contains coordinates of points which it is impossible to pass through.

If the input data is incorrect at any moment program ends with: ***ERROR X***, where ***X*** is a number of the line, that the first problem appeared.

Project operates on self written ***Bitset*** and ***Queue*** structures.
