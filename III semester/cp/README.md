# ***Concurrent Programming ‚ù§***

## Workshop (Java)

The program creates different stations and different workshops inside which on given entry data threads can operate and switch between each stations (only in the workshop they are in).

## Executor (C)

The program runs tasks given in entry data, it can run programs, write data to output or error, kill the executor of the tasks. Programs run by the executor, as the others instructions are done concurrently. 

## Circus (C++)

The program is about running the fast food restaruant in which are different machines that each creates different product, clients can place orders. Creation and completition of orders is done concurrently.

## Labs

Directory contains solutions to all of the laboratories "small" assignments that were required to do on every other week during the laboratories to get a point for the solution.

This directory contains many solutions in different programming languages (Java, C, C++) that concurrent programming was introduced in during the semester.
