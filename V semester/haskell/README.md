# Haskell assignments 

Each task was designed to discover and learn Haskell from basics to more advanced level.

## Sokoban-codeworld

This file contains the version of Sokoban game written entirely in Haskell from scratch. 

It was my first encounter with Haskell and I was learning the language a lot during the task.

The game has many different levels with difficulty ranging from easy to very difficult.

## Sokoban-terminal

This file contains solution to task same as sokoban-codeworld, but this time the game is played in terminal window.

Characters used to represent Sokoban objects:

```haskell
wall -> '#'
ground -> ' '
storage -> '.'
box -> '$'
terminalPlayer -> '@'
```

## Supply 

This file contains solution to task that was designed to teach us more advanced Haskell possibilities and high-level functional programming (Functors, Applicative, Monads).

## Graph & Set

Both files contain a solution to the task I was given during another course with Haskell programming. 

The task covered writing functions to operate on: Set structure such as: Union, Member and converting to List; Graph structure such as: connecting edges, creating and merging graphs.
