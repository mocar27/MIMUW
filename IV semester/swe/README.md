# ***Software engineering***

As a project for Software engineering course we've built an application, in a team of 4, for scraping prices from Allegro and sending emails as notifications.

It was written from scratch. It was developed in Python using Django.

Frontend has been developed in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Project was later deployed in Heroku, but currently it is not on.

Project was made in collaboration with [@JKuziola](https://github.com/JKuziola), [@wojsza05](https://github.com/wojsza05), [@koxkox111](https://github.com/koxkox111).
