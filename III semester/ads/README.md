# ***Algorithms and data structures***
Laborathorites on these course were designed to introduce basic competitive programming skills and algorithms.

All the tasks were short, quick programs submitted to checking site to verify the solution, one task every week or two.

Two tasks were more difficult than the others, treated as grading programs - ***cho.cpp** and ***kom.cpp***.

The optimal solution to ***Kom.cpp***, task which name was "Strike Committee", was to implement an algorithm based on dynamic programming enriched with a caterpillar algorithm.

The optimal solution to ***Cho.cpp***, task which name was "Christmas Tree", was to implement algorithm based on interval tree data structure.
