## Telephones (Telefony)

This program performs different operations on phone numbers using Trie structure, such as: 

* Adding redirections, from one phone to another.
* Getting reverse redirections - getting all phones that are redirected to given number.
* Removing and quickly, linearly, deleting whole Trie structure, depending on the number of nodes in the Trie.
