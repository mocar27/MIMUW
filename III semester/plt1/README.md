# ***Programming languages and tools 1***

This course was based on introducing and improving students' knowledge of various C++ possibilities and functions.

During these classes we've been working almost entirly using C++20.

Every project was made in pair, except for the last task. This was obligatory element of the course to improve soft skills and cooperation.

Every task will have a very short description of what part of C++ the project was based on.

Full description of every task is available inside each directory (content of the tasks is available only in Polish).
