# "BajtTrade" task

This is one of two bigger projects I was told to do as a part of Object-oriented programming course.

The program simulates the one of three types of stock markets depending on which one you choose in the input JSON data.

There are two types of stock market players: 

* Worker - with four career paths, buying techniques, production strategies and five learning techniques;
* Speculator - with three types of trading strategies, because he doesn't produce anything.

There are five products, every each one with advancement levels and bonuses.
